This is a lightweight webcam program written in Python utilizing the OpenCV library and wxPython for the GUI. The task was to create a small cross-platform program to capture images.
Currently the program is in alpha, with only the webcam stream showing and a capture button.

This is mostly meant as a programming exercise, but feel free to use it!
